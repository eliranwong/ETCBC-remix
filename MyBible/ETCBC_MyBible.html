</p>
  
<h2>Bible modules</h2>
<p>
<b>BHS versification:</b><br />
(original versification; academic articles and lexicons use this versification)
- BHS5.SQLite3 ( Hebrew text + tagging linked to ETCBC+ dictionary + Hebrew morphology )<br />
- BHS5m.SQLite3 ( Hebrew text + tagging linked to ETCBC+ dictionary + Hebrew morphology + clause linebreak + clause marker + phrase marker + phrase-dependent verb highlighted in red + phrase-dependent proper noun emphasized )<br />
<br /><br />
<b>KJV versification:</b><br />
(most bible translations use versification based on KJV with slight variations; modules below were designed for comparing Hebrew text with common translations)
- BHS5k.SQLite3 ( Hebrew text + tagging linked to ETCBC+ dictionary + Hebrew morphology )<br />
- BHS5km.SQLite3 ( Hebrew text + tagging linked to ETCBC+ dictionary + Hebrew morphology + clause linebreak + clause marker + phrase marker + phrase-dependent verb highlighted in red + phrase-dependent proper noun emphasized )<br />
</b><br />
<b>Notes:</b>
- difference in versification between BHS and KJV are marked in the text, where applicable (e.g. Psalm 13).<br />
- to control appearance of emphasized proper noun in BHS5m or BHS5km, go to "Settings > Themes > Emaphasized words"
- to select font at "Settings > Themes > Verse text"
</p>

<h2>Commentary module</h2>
<p>
<b>File: ETCBC.commentaries.SQLite3</b><br />
  It is a verse-by-verse commentary.  Commentary on each verse are consisted of three parts, which are to be described below.<br />
  remarks:<br />
  - this commentary file are conformed into KJV versification, to facilitate comparisons with most common translation.<br />
  - where versification different from original BHS are marked and linked, i.e. users can easily navigate to BHS text in original versification.<br />
  - this file could be used independently or opened in parallel with different bible modules
</p>
<p><b>PART I - Hebrew text</b><br />
  - the text of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, edited by Karl Elliger and Wilhelm Rudolph, Fifth Revised Edition, edited by Adrian Schenker, © 1977 and 1997 Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart.<br />
  - each Hebrew word is tagged and linked to ETCBC+ dictionary described later.
</p>
<p>
<p><b>PART II - clause and phrase analysis</b>
<br /><br />
<b>Data on clause analysis:</b><br />
Division of clauses is represented by use of horizontal lines, followed by headings including information below (where applicable):<br />
- rough clause type<br />
- clause type<br />
- clause constituent relation<br />
Please refere to https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/0_overview.html for full features.
<br /><br />
<b>Data on phrase analysis:</b><br />
Division of phrases is represented by use of rows in tables.  Each row has Hebrew words in each phrase on its left side and following data information on the right side, where applicalbe:<br />
- phrase type<br />
- phrase atom relation<br />
- determination<br />
- phrase function<br />
Please refere to https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/0_overview.html for full features.
</p>
<p><b>PART III - word analysis</b>
Every Hebrew word in each verse is given information on:
- first line (from right to left): qere reading (where applicable), manuscript form, transliteration, Hebrew lexeme, English gloss
- second line: morphology (tagged with links to facilitate searching the Hebrew text for each combination of Hebrew lexeme and morphology.  To take advantage of these links, click it and seach in BHS5 or BHS5[k]m bible module, you should expect list of all verses having the same set of combination of Hebrew lexeme and morphology.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Taggings:</b><br />
All bible modules in this collection are tagged with the following features, to work with dictionary module, "ETCBC4c"<br />
- ETCBC morphology (word & pronominal suffix)<br />
- dedicated numbers for ETCBC lexemes<br />
- dedicated numbers for ETCBC data on morpheme<br />
- all ketiv and qere readings are displayed, with different colors.  In addition to difference in color, morphological codes specify which those are qere readings.
</p>

<h2>Search on Lexeme or Lexeme_&_Morphology</h2>
<p><b>Locate lexeme:</b><br />
First, searching for morphological data alone is not helpful if searches are not connected with lexemes.  
Typing Hebrew letters in mobile devices is fine, but typing Hebrew vowels in mobile devices is difficult, if not impossible.  
Therefore, 9236 lexemes in ETCBC 4c data are assigned with numbers from 70001 to 79236 for easier typing.  
In this MyBible collection, it is easy to check the number associated with the lexeme.  
In all bible modules in this collections, except the phono version ETCBCp(k).SQLite, you can read article on ditionary lookup of each word, 
where you can find corresponding Hebrew lexemes and numbers assigned to them.  
For example, you will get קרא and H70027 with ETCBC dictionary on clicking יִּקְרָ֨א in Genesis 1:5.  
If you turn on display for Strong's number you can simply find 70027 right next to word.
</p>
<p><b>Search for words based on particular lexeme(s):</b><br />
To search all variants of a particular lexeme, say, קרא , simply use Strong's number search function available in MyBile, 
by clicking the number 70027 or typing manually.<br />
You may also search multiple words appear in same verses, say, try to search for H70003 H70004.  (please note that a space is requited between separate nubmers in the search field)
</p>
<p><b>Search for lexeme together with morphological data:</b><br />
To search for lexeme together with morphological data, say יִּקְרָ֨א in Genesis 1:5 is based on lexeme קרא and its full morphology is "verb, qal, wayyiqtol, third person, masculine, singular", simply click the 8-digit numbers next to the 5-digit numbers and click search.  With this you will get all verses having variants of קרא tagged with morphological data "verb, qal, wayyiqtol, third person, masculine, singular".<br />
Remarks: You can also do it in ETCBC ditionary, by clicking linked morphology in analytical lexicon and proceed the search.
</p>
<p><b>Filtering on searching morphological data:</b><br />
You can do partial moropholgy search with ETCBCq(k).SQLite3, few examples below:<br />
- to search all words of קרא ONLY in verbal stem pual OR nif, use "word search" and type "L70027.verb.pual | L70027.verb.nif" and proceed the search.<br />
- to search all words of קרא ONLY in all verbal stems EXCEPT qal, use "word search" and type "L70027.verb & ~ L70027.verb.qal" and proceed the search.<br />
- to search all words of קרא ONLY in participle forms, use "word search" and type "L70027.verb.____.ptca" and proceed the search.<br />
- to search all words of קרא ONLY in participle AND plural forms, use "word search" and type "L70027.verb.____.ptca.__._.pl" and proceed the search.
<br />
<b>Remarks: </b><br />
- Searching codes are available when users click "CODES" in beginning of each verse.  <br />

</p>
<p>
<u>Notes on lexemes: </u><br />
https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/featuredoc/features/comments/vocalized_lexeme.html<br />
The values of vocalized lexeme look like the values of the g_lex_utf8 feature of word occurrences, but they are not the same. The vocalized lexeme is an idealized (aka paradigmatic), pointed representation of the lexeme, which may or may not occur in the text. The g_lex_utf8 is the realized lexeme in a concrete occurrence, of which it may be a part.
</p>
<p>
<u>Notes on part-of-speech: </u><br />
Users may find of part-of-speech information appeared in morphology different from part-of-speech information in lexical entry.  Part-of-speech information in morphology are phrase dependent part-of-speech.  You may read more below on "phrase dependent part-of-speech".
</p>
<u>Notes on phrase dependent part-of-speech: </u><br />
https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/pdp.html<br />
The part of speech that is assigned to a word based on its phrase context rather than on its lexical identity.
