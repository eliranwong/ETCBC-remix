<b>Installation: </b>Install all files to enjoy full features of this collection.<br />
<b>[1] BHS5.bbli (bible module): </b>Simply the text of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (Fifth Revised Edition)<br />
<b>[2] BHS5m.bbli (bible module): </b>Text of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (Fifth Revised Edition) + each clause begins with a linebreak and marked by symbol "*" + each phase is marked by a pair of bracklets, "[" and "]" + all phrase-dependent verbs highlighted in red + all phrase-dependent proper nouns highlighted in olive<br />
<b>[3] ETCBC.bbli (bible module): </b>tagged with notes (ETCBC Hebrew lexeme and related information, Strong's number and related information, reference of entry of Hebrew analytical lexicon, Hebrew morphology).  Notes are either "N" or "R" followed by numbers in superscipts.<br />
<b>[4] ETCBC+.bbli (bile module): </b>on top of materials found in ETCBC.bbli, Strong's numbers links and interlinear Egnlish gloss are added.<br />
<b>[5] ETCBCi.bbli (bile module): </b>Traditional interlinear view of data inlcuding, Hebrew ketiv words, transliteration, lexeme, Lexical No, Strong's no., morphology, and qere readings.  This module looks nice ONLY in Mac/iOS/iPhone e-Sword X/HD/LT, due to current limitations of PC e-Sword.<br />
<b>[4] ETCBC.dcti (dictionary module): </b>Lexical entry with ETCBC data; Hebrew analytical lexicon; Strong's numbers links<br />
<b>[5] SECE.lexi (dictionary module): </b>Strong's Exhausative Concordance (Enhanced) + 6 unabridged BDB articles on 6 Hebrew words, which are out of normal range of Strong's numbers.
</p>
<h2>Dictionary Lookup</h2>
<p>
<b>Three kinds of dictionary entry in bible modules:</b><br />
First, "R" follows by numbers (from R1 to R9236) - this set are arranged according to 9236 Hebrew lexemes in ETCBC database (lexems which are of same spellings but different meanings are assigned with different numbers [different slots in ETCBC database]; Hebrew words corresponding Aramaic words are assigned with different numbers [different slots in ETCBC database])<br />
Second, "M" follows by numbers (from N1 to N641) - this set gives you Hebrew morphology based on ETCBC database<br />
Third, "H" follows by numbers (from H1 to H8674 and from H9001 to H9006) H1-H8674 are ordinary Strong's numbers, H9001-H9006 are prepositions/conjunctions/particles, which are not specified in Strong's numbers system.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mac Users (e-Sword X):</b><br />
- all entries are linked in bible modules, a simple click on one of them brings up a popup window.<br />
- in popup window of "R" number entries, only brief information is given for quick overview.  To read full article of Hebrew analytical lexicon, RIGHT CLICK the "R" numbers in the HEADER, and SELECT "DEFINE".<br />
- in popup window of Strong's number entries, click the linked Strong's number to view the full article in lexicon view.<br />
- To lookup ETCBC data from SECE lexicon, RIGHT CLICK the "R" numbers, and SELECT "DEFINE".<br />
- To lookup Strong's number from ETCBC dictionary, simply click those linked Strong's numbers.
</p>
<p>
<b>iOS Users; iPad (e-Sword HD) / iPhone (e-Sowrd LT):</b><br />
Usages in iOS interface should be similar to those in e-Sword X, except "Long-Tapping" in iOS platform, rather than "right click" and "select lookup" rather than "select define".
</p>
<p>
<b>PC version:</b><br />
- Strong's numbers are linked, a simple mouse hover does the lookup.<br />
- at the time of writing this description, PC version of e-Sword doesn't support non-encrpyted notes, that makes "R" and "N" numbers are unlinked in bible modules.  With that said, PC users could still take advantage of unique dictionary lookup features in PC e-Sword, by clicking directly on "R" or "N" numbers, corresponding articles would then come up in ETCBC dictionary.<br />
- To lookup ETCBC data from SECE lexicon, click the "R" numbers, and locate dictionary article in ETCBC dictionary.<br />
- To lookup Strong's number from ETCBC dictionary, simply click those linked Strong's numbers.<br />
IMPORTANT remarks: html rendering in current PC version of e-Sword is still yet to be good.  Mixing of Hebrew words and English behaves different as expected.  Hope future update of PC version may correct the problem.
